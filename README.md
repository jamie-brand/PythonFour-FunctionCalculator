# Python Four-Function Calculator

This project uses Python to calculate 1 of 4 types of functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) using 2 numbers. The user specifies which calculation to perform and inputs the first and second numbers. The program then computes the specified calculation using the input numbers, and outputs a summary of the request and the result. Finally, the program asks the user whether to perform a new calculation, thereby restarting the calculator. 

Program created with Python 3.11.4.
